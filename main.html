    <h2>Nanded City</h2>
    <img src="i1.jpg" style="width: 100%;">
    <p>Nanded is mentioned in Mahabharata as place of Bharat’s maternal grandparents. In the 1st century CE, power in the area lay with the Andhrabhrtyas and Satvahanas. In the 5th and 4th centuries BCE, Nanded was ruled by the Nanda dynasty. In the 3rd century BCE (about 272 to 231 BCE), it was part of the Maurya Empire under Ashoka. Local irrigation practices and Nanded itself are recorded in the treatise, Leela Charitra (late 1200s CE). Nanded was the birthplace of three Marathi poet-saints—Vishnupant Shesa, Raghunath Shesa, and Vaman Pandit Construction of Kandhar Fort, located in Kandhar, is attributed to the Rashtrakuta king Krishna III of Malkheda who ruled around 10th century CE.</p>
    <p>From 1636, Nanded was the centre of governance of Nizam State, which includes present-day Telangana and Karnataka, and was an imperial province of the Mughal Badshah (emperor) Shah Jahan. In 1657, Nanded merged into Bidah Subah. Guru Nanak (1469 – 1539 CE) passed through Nanded on his way to Sri Lanka. Guru Gobind Singh (1666 – 1708 CE) arrived in Nanded with the Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah I (1643 – 1712 CE) near the end of August in 1707 CE. When Bahadur Shah moved on to Golconda, Guru Gobind Singh remained in Nanded. Guru Gobind Singh proclaimed he was the last (tenth) living guru and established the sacred text, the Guru Granth Sahib as an eternal “living” leader. Guru Gobind Singh died without a lineal descendant due to the martyrdom of his four sons.</p>
    <p>In 1725, Nanded became part of Hyderabad State. In about 1835, Maharaja Ranjit Singh commissioned the construction of a gurdwara at Nanded with the financial aid of Sikander Jah (3rd Nizam of hyderabad). It was built on the site of Guru Gobind Singh’s cremation. The gurdwara is part of the Hazur Sahib.</p>
    <p>After India gained independence in 1947, the Indian Armed Forces annexed Hyderabad and ended the rule of the Nizam in Operation Polo, making Nanded part of the new Hyderabad State. Nanded remained part of the Hyderabad state until 1956 when it was included in the Bombay Presidency.</p>
    <p>On 1 May 1960, Maharashtra state was created on a linguistic basis and the Marathi dominant Nanded district became part of Maharashtra. In December 2022, 25 Nanded district villages renewed their demand to merge with Telangana.</p>
