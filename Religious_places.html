Mahur is the birthplace of Hindu God Dattatreya. Dattatreya parents Atri Rishi and Sati Anasuya Mata lived here. Brahmadev, Vishnudev and Lord Shiva once got a news about Anusaya Mata that there is no one more pious and pure as her. To test her piousness they arrived under the garb of asking Alm (bhiksha). Near Mahur, There is a Pious confluence of River Penganga and River Pus at Hiwara Sangam village, Tal. Mahagaon Vidarbha, from where the river flows northward. Penganga river forms a border between Vidarbha and Marathwada. Mahur falls just about 3kms inside Marathwada due to river banks.</p>
    <p>There are three mountains in Mahur. The first one is having Renuka Mahar devi mata Temple, who is mother of the god Parshuram. Other two are called Datta Shikhar and Atri Anasuya Shikar Temples. Datta Shikhar is highest of all. Mahur has a sacred temple to Renuka Mata, which is considered one of the three and half Shakti Peethas (temples) in the state. A big fair is held here every year on the occasion of Vijayadashami.</p>
